This is the home page of the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) Building Blocks for HTTP APIs (HTTPAPI) Working Group.

{: .banner}
Our mission is create standard technical specifications to improve use of HTTP for machine-to-machine communications, including HTTP extensions, formats, and best practices.

See our:

* [Charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpapi/about/) - our scope of work
* [Working Group Materials](https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/wg-materials) - agendas, minutes, etc.
* [Mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/httpapi) - announcements, calls for consensus, and general discussion of our work
* [Discussion repo](https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/discussion/discussions) - alternative venue for discussing ideas about new specifications

## Current and Upcoming Work

The group is currently working on the following specifications (in the GitHub repository indicated):

* [The Deprecation HTTP Header Field](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-deprecation-header/) - _[repository](https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/deprecation-header)_
* [The Idempotency-Key HTTP Header Field](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header/) - _[repository](https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/idempotency)_
* [Linkset: Media Types and a Link Relation Type for Link Sets](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-linkset/) - _[repository](https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/linkset)_
* [RateLimit Fields for HTTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers/) - _[repository](https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/ratelimit-headers)_
* [Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-rfc7807bis/) - _[repository](https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/rfc7807bis)_

See also the [official document listing](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpapi/documents/).

We talk about potential future work on the mailing list and in the [discussion repo](https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/discussion/discussions).


## Who Should Participate

We think that the following sorts of people will be able to effectively contribute to this work:

* **HTTP standards experts**: Those with deep understanding of and experience with the protocol
* **API practitioners**: Those who create, operate, and use HTTP APIs often
* **API vendors**: Those who provide products (commercial or Open Source) for serving, designing, securing, etc. APIs

Others are, of course, welcome to join.


## How to Participate

**Everyone who participates needs to understand the [IETF NOTE WELL](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/) conditions**. This includes the Intellectual Property terms, code of conduct, and other important policies.

If you plan on actively participating, subscribing to the [working group mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/httpapi) is encouraged but not required.

Anyone can make comments or pull requests to the specification repositories (see above).
